This is going to be a new test of intensive blogging. I like to write more but existing tools are distracting me from what it is about so I am trying out this one. Just short to the point stories with references and not too much distraction.

== Test of syntax

This tool you can find on link:http://hubpress.io/[hubpress.io] and there is not much more to do except *bold* and _ for _italic_ and  

* for
* list

Hope to see you soon!
